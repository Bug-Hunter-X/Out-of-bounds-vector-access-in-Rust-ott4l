This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: accessing an element of a vector using an index that is out of bounds.  The `bug.rs` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.rs` provides a corrected version.  The error arises because the index 10 is greater than the largest valid index (1). Accessing elements outside the valid range leads to a runtime panic.  The solution demonstrates safe access using `.get()` which handles the case of an invalid index gracefully.
